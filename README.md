**ENTWINE**

ENTWINE is a software (coded in C) to simulate a model of gene regulation and development that is abstract enough to allow for developmental noise, epistasis, pleiotropy, plasticity and other genetic mechanisms to arise realistically as a consequence of the network of gene interaction. By bringing together both the evolutionary perspective with the molecular perspectives of plastic responses, ENTWINEâ€™s philosophy is rooted within the field of integrative biology.

Sorry, there is no manual!

The main author is Jeremy A. Draghi. I (Remi Matthey-Doret) only made a few modifications in order to improve performance as well as in order to allow implementatino of temporal environmental heteroogeneity as well as pllastic responses in responose to a performance signal.
